docker compose exec app npm install
docker compose exec app npm run build

# Setup application
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### 3. Accessing the Platform
- **Student Portal**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost:8000/admin` (Default: `admin@lms.com` / `12345678`)
- **API Documentation**: Accessible via `routes/api.php` contracts.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

We maintain a high test coverage across all core features (Authentication, Enrollment, Completion, and API Security).

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan test
```

## ✨ Key Features & Technical Highlights

- 🛡️ **Security-First**: Integrated **Laravel Sanctum** for mobile security and **Policies** to gate premium lesson content.
- 📦 **Clean Code**: Strict **Repository Pattern** implementation with **Dependency Injection** via the `RepositoryServiceProvider`.
- 🔄 **Idempotent Operations**: Database-level unique constraints and atomic `Actions` prevent race conditions during enrollment or certificate issuance.
- 🌍 **Localized Core**: Native support for **Arabic and English** using translatable JSON columns and dynamic locale switching.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous Workflows**: Real-time event broadcasting (e.g., `CourseCompleted`) combined with queued jobs (PDF generation, Email delivery).
